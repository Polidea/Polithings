ULN2003 driver for Android Things
================================

This driver supports ULN2003 driver with 28BYJ-48 Stepper Motor.<br/>
[This](http://42bots.com/tutorials/28byj-48-stepper-motor-with-uln2003-driver-and-arduino-uno/) tutorial helped us developing our driver.<br/>

How to use the driver
---------------------

### Gradle dependency

To use the `uln2003` driver, simply add the line below to your project's `build.gradle`,
where `<version>` matches the last version of the driver available on [maven central](https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.polidea.androidthings.driver%22).

```
dependencies {
    compile 'com.polidea.androidthings.driver:uln2003:<version>'
}
```

### Hardware Setup
Connect all four "in" pins on uln2003 driver into GPIOs available on your board.

### Sample usage of high level Stepper Motor Driver

```kotlin
com.polidea.androidthings.driver.uln2003.motor.ULN2003StepperMotor

// select gpio pins on your board for uln2003 input pins

val in1Pin = "BCM4"
val in2Pin = "BCM17"
val in3Pin = "BCM27"
val in4Pin = "BCM22"

val stepper = ULN2003StepperMotor(in1GpioId = in1Pin,
                                  in2GpioId = in2Pin,
                                  in3GpioId = in3Pin,
                                  in4GpioId = in4Pin)
                                  
//Perform a rotation and add rotation listener
stepper.rotate(degrees = 180.0,
        direction = Direction.CLOCKWISE,
        resolutionId = ULN2003Resolution.HALF.id,
        rpm = 2.5,
        rotationListener = object : RotationListener {
            override fun onStarted() {
                Log.i(TAG, "rotation started")
            }
            override fun onFinishedSuccessfully() {
                Log.i(TAG, "rotation finished")
            }
            override fun onFinishedWithError(degreesToRotate: Double, rotatedDegrees: Double, exception: Exception) {
                Log.e(TAG, "error, degrees to rotate: {$degreesToRotate}  rotated degrees: {$rotatedDegrees}")
            }
        })
        
// Close the ULN2003StepperMotor when all moves are finished. Otherwise close() will terminate current and pending rotations.
stepper.close()
```

You can call `rotate` method multiple times. All tasks will be queued and invoked synchronously on a separate thread.<br/>
Remember, if you close ULN2003StepperMotor during the execution process you'll be notified about the error from the running task only.

### Sample usage of ULN2003

```kotlin
package com.polidea.androidthings.driver.uln2003.driver.ULN2003

// select gpio pins on your board for uln2003 input pins

val in1Pin = "BCM4"
val in2Pin = "BCM17"
val in3Pin = "BCM27"
val in4Pin = "BCM22"

val uln2003 = ULN2003(in1GpioId = in1Pin,
                      in2GpioId = in2Pin,
                      in3GpioId = in3Pin,
                      in4GpioId = in4Pin)
                      
// Open uln2003 gpios
uln2003.open()

//Set direction
uln2003.direction = Direction.COUNTERCLOCKWISE

//Set resolution
uln2003.resolution = ULN2003Resolution.FULL

//Perform a step
uln2003.performStep(StepDuration(1))

// Close the ULN2003 when finished. 
uln2003.close()
```

Performing a half step gives you higher resolution and torque, but its maximum speed is lower than in a full step mode.<br/>
